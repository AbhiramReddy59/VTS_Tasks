<meta name="description" content="Welcome to our responsive multi-page website">{
This tag provides a brief description of the webpage. It’s important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) because search engines may use this text to show a summary of the page in search results.
The description helps users understand what the page is about before they click the link.

The <nav> element is used in HTML to define a navigation section on a webpage. It is a semantic element, meaning it has a clear, specific purpose, which helps both humans and search engines understand the structure of a webpage.

Here’s why the <nav> element is used in your example:

Indicates Navigation Links: The <nav> element groups the links that are primarily used for navigating the website, such as "Home," "About," "Services," "Blog," and "Contact." It tells the browser and screen readers that these links are part of the main navigation, improving accessibility.

Improves Accessibility: Screen readers can recognize the <nav> tag and provide context for users with disabilities. This helps them navigate directly to the site’s main navigation.

Semantic Structure: Using <nav> helps create a clean and meaningful structure in your HTML code. Instead of just placing links in random spots, it defines a specific area where the main navigation will appear. This makes the HTML more readable and maintainable for developers.

SEO Benefits: Since search engines also prioritize understanding the structure of a page, using <nav> can help them identify the main navigation links, which can be useful for indexing the site properly.

In your example, the <nav> element contains:

The website's logo (<div class="logo">).
A list of links (<ul class="nav-links">) for different pages.
A search bar (<div class="search-bar">) for site-wide search functionality.

grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
This defines the layout of the columns in the grid.
repeat(3, 1fr): This is shorthand to create 3 equal-width columns, each taking up one fraction (1fr) of the available space.
1fr means "1 fraction of the available space." The grid container will divide the total width into 3 equal parts, with each part assigned to a column.
So, grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); creates 3 equally sized columns inside the .service-grid.
